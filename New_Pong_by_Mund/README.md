# Glitchping by Mund
This is Glitchping by Mund. A new version of the well known game ping.

## Differences
1.  In Glitchping by Mund the paddles accelerate and have friction.
2.  There are no hard borders. If you go outside the canvas you teleport back.
3.  The ball is now controllable by the paddles.
